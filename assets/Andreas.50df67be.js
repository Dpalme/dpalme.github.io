They wanted a simple page that was going to be shared through social media in which you put in your name and you get a flower and a song. Results needed to be easily sharable in instagram and twitter. </p><p> I did some initial sketches to get their feedback and built a system that hashed the input name using md5 to get a random index from the list of flowers. I used petite-vue because it was a simple enough project that I could use it to learn a new technology and the dynamic elements of the page where relatively minimal. </p><h3>Design Principles</h3><p> Seeing as the main goal was driving traffic to the music video, the main CTA needed to be to go see it. </p><p> Since it was going to be mainly advertised in instagram, the design needed to be mobile fist. </p><p> Since the collaboration was with an american band and the lyrics were in english, there needed to be an option to use it in english, but since the band and most of its audience is mexican, it should also be available in spanish. </p><h3>References and inspiration</h3><figure class="mx-a text-c"><img src="'+c+'" alt="Andreas Cover Art" height="320"><figcaption class="small">The cover art for the single</figcaption></figure><figure class="mx-a text-c"><img src="'+l+'" alt="Andreas Music Video photoshoot" height="320"><figcaption class="small"> Pictures from the music video to get an idea of the look&amp;feel of it </figcaption></figure><h3>The design</h3><p> Taking everything into consideration I decided to use a minimal, free-flow setup. Firstly I incorporated the obi strip from the cover art into the design, I set its width at 320px across so that it can fit a slim phone or a big screen withough losing it&#39;s internal structure and &quot;strip&quot; feel. </p><p> I also placed a big play button in the center to act as a link to the music video. Placing outbound links as your main CTA drives SEO down, but since word of mouth was going to be the main source of traffic, it didn&#39;t matter. </p><p> Finally I defined three main states: Default, Inputing name, Results screen as well as the transitions between them. This later helped structure the code and cohesion between components. </p><figure class="text-c"><img src="'+h+'" alt="Figma design screens for the website" style="width:75%;"><figcaption class="small"> The screens for the 3 viewports in all 3 states. </figcaption></figure></div></div><div class="section container fade"><div class="card"><h2>Insights and Learnings</h2><p> First off I learnt the basics of petite-vue (and vue in general) which gave me insight into how Vue and React do things alike and differently. </p><p> I also reinforced my ability to turn vague ideas into functional requirements and design decisons. </p></div></div>',3),m={class:"section container"},k=s({setup(u){return(g,f)=>(n(),o(r,null,[e("article",null,[t(i,{title:"Andreas",description:"Freelance Work",tags:["Figma","Petite-Vue"],link:"https://dpalmer.in/Andreas"},null,8,["link"]),p]),e("div",m,[t(a,{cardWidth:"t",hideDetails:!1})])],64))}});export{k as default};
